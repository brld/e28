*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you
are reviewing. Include context and code examples in your answers when
relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
I did not produce any warnings or errors in the console throughout my time testing this project.

### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?
The website appeared to be a joke browsing website yet there were elements mixed into it reminiscent of a shopping service, likely due to the fact that it was adapted from zipfoods. The shopping features seemed to function as intended although even keeping the functionality the same but renaming some of the features (i.e. "Cart" to "Liked Jokes") would integrate them into the project much more seamlessly.

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
A lot of the components / methods in the project still followed the ZipFoods naming schema making it very difficult to navigate the code and determine which pieces were linked to which function (For example the products actually serve as the jokes, there's a ShowFeatured component despite there being no "Featured" page, etc.)

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?
I was able to take this opportunity to more closely examine a fully functional .scss file as used in a working application, since I have solely used CSS in my web development projects.

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
There were some redundant files in the project (components / pages which could have been used in a feature for the project but were not) and the names of the methods / components did not relate to the main function of the project.

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
The outlined features in the README.md did not match with the features layed out in practice. And it may be helpful for the future to have more detailed commit messages both for the original developer and future collaborators that review the repository ("Added functional categories page" or "Added final features and completed project").
